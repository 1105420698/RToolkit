RunkaiKit allows developers to gain access to a lot of useful tools for Swift. 

List of features:
- General iOS API calls
- Rift (A work in progress Swift based programming language) _incomplete_
- RMath - a math library containing functions that performs Algebra and Calculus operations _incomplete_

Roadmap:
:x: Make Rift flexible to accommodate all your needs.
:x: Add complex functions into RMath to allow people to actually use RMath.
