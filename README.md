# RunkaiKit

> Hi! Welcome to RunkaiKit! You are welcome to check it out in your projects, but make sure to keep this in mind:
> I am still a student and learning to become a software engineer, I am very sorry if my messy code brings
> you any inconvenience. School is busy for me so I might not be able to respond to or fix a bug in days time.

RunkaiKit allows developers to gain access to a lot of useful tools for Swift. 

List of features:
- General iOS API calls
- Rift (A work in progress Swift based programming language) _incomplete_
- RMath - a math library containing functions that performs Algebra and Calculus operations _incomplete_

Roadmap:

Status: Not Complete - Make Rift flexible to accommodate all your needs.

Status: Not Complete - Add complex functions into RMath to allow people to actually use RMath.
